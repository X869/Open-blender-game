# Open-blender-game
This Project is my attempt at creating software that anyone can contribute to. It is a game, However I will only be providing the base of the project and you can contribute to it! 

# How to install

Go to blender.org and download blender 2.79b open the ProjectBase.blend file and Enjoy!

*Note if you are running Ubuntu and have snap store or GNOME software shop then download the blender version with the shinier-looking and more 3D icon
